# Python-VirtualCoffeeMachine
My  Basic Python Mini project of Virtual Coffee Machine
# ☕ Coffee Machine Program

A simple coffee machine simulator built in Python that lets users choose a drink, insert coins, and receive their coffee — or get a refund if they don’t pay enough.

## 📂 Features
- Select drinks: **Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte**
- Manage resources (water, milk, coffee)
- Handle coin transactions (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
- Refund money if not enough coins are inserted
- View available resources with a **report** command
- Turn off the machine with the **off** command

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install Python (if not already installed)
2. Save the code as `coffee_machine.py`
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python coffee_machine.py
```

## 🏁 Example Flow
```
What would you like? (espresso/cappuccino/latte): latte
Please insert coins.
How many quarters? 10
How many dimes? 0
How many nickels? 0
How many pennies? 0
Here is your change: $7.50
Here is your latte ☕ Enjoy!
```

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Add more drink options
- Allow restocking of resources
- Build a GUI version with **Tkinter**

Let me know if this format works better! 🚀✨
